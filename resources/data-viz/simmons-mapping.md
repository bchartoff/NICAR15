##Color (and shape and place) my world
###Day 2, 11:20, Rob Simmons, Jim Herries

- Kinda cool use of pie charts...[DC metro map](http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/16811/which-metro-stations-are-the-most-balanced/)
- Rob likes Hammer-Aitoff for global map (equal area)
	- or Mollweide (straight lines of latitude)
- Albers equal area is nice for US, check out [this esri tool](http://esri.maps.arcgis.com/home/) to find, Albers web maps, plus lots of other things.
	- NB Albers map recognizable by curved US/ Canada border, not straight line
- Interesting esri map on walkability to bars, by neighborhood. From census data, (interesting for upcoming urban proj?)
